## Project Overview

This repository contains R code to **simulate, analyze, and visualize the effect of tillage intensity on agricultural runoff water temperature**.  
It is designed to help researchers test statistical methods, power, and workflows before collecting or analyzing field data.

The simulation mimics an experiment comparing three tillage systems:
- CT: Conventional Tillage
- MT: Minimum Tillage
- ST: Strip Tillage

For each tillage level, the model generates inflow and outflow water temperatures for a specified number of replicate plots. The resulting synthetic dataset allows rapid exploration of ANOVA and nonparametric methods for detecting tillage effects.
